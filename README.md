# Unregulated Contaminant Monitoring Rule Analysis

## Purpose
This repo contains a brief analysis and visualization of the US EPA's Unregulated Contaminant Monitoring Rule (UCMR) 4 dataset. It is intended as a work sample only and should not be used for decision-making.

## About the Dataset
UCMR 4 contains drinking water analytical results for contaminants that were unregulated by the Safe Drinking Water Act at the time of sample collection. UCMR 4 samples were collected from large public water systems serving 10,000 people or more across the United States between 2018 and 2020. The data is publicly available from the [US EPA](https://www.epa.gov/dwucmr/occurrence-data-unregulated-contaminant-monitoring-rule#4) and unzipped copies are available in the __Data/Raw__ folder of this repo. Due to GitHub file size limitations, the Occurrence Data By State option was used. Further details about the dataset are provided in the [UCMR 4 Data Summary](https://www.epa.gov/sites/default/files/2018-10/documents/ucmr4-data-summary.pdf).
